# Something about me!

Welcome to my GitHub Page! My name is Joaquin Acosta and I enjoy learning about new things and share this passion with others. I love to work with hardware, specially DIY and Open-Source projects, I thrive in creating tools to help others. If I can dissamble and reassemble it, I can understand more about how it works.
